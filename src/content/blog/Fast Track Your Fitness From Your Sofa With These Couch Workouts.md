Even though we may soon be allowed back in the gym in South Africa, not
everyone might be ready for that. We are, after all, still in the middle of a
pandemic (a fact which many are choosing to ignore nowadays) and resuming
normal activities only aggravates that situation. So, for those who want to
work up a sweat and start chiselling their summer body, but don't want to
return to germ-infested locker rooms, home workout are the way to go.
Motivation doesn't always run high, though, so we've compiled some workouts
using a somewhat unconventional piece of equipment. Whatever your workout
goals may be, your living room sofa will be your new best friend with these
couch workouts â€“perfect for lazy days and small spaces.

### Blogilates couch workout

We've mentioned this channel before in our **_Who Needs Gym When You Have
Youtube_** article, and it's making an appearance again here for good reason.
Though Cassey Ho looks sweet, her workouts BURN, and they'll have you swearing
at the screen in minutes wishing she'd just drop dead (of course, we don't
mean it. We need her. She keeps our abs firm). Here's her take on how to use
your sofa as a great piece of workout equipment:

### Chloe Ting's couch workout

I'm a big fan of Chloe Ting and her free workout programs. Regardless of what
you're trying to achieve with your workouts, Chloe has a program for you.
They're not easy, but they work. The best thing about her channel is that
she's a little quieter than Cassey Ho. There's less talking, more sweating,
and some pretty catchy music to help you keep up the pace. I highly recommend
checking out some of her other videos too, but to kick off your workout,
here's her couch workout: [embed]https://youtu.be/AenFz9fTdpg[/embed]

### Popsugar couch workout

This is a good one for any age and any fitness goal. Get the whole family
involved (if you have the space and couches available) and motivate each
other! Like the Blogilates videos, these can be a little noisy as there's a
lot of talking in between, but if you're into having someone make conversation
while you train, it just might be the perfect addition to your new sofa

### JHoff Fitness higher grade sofa workout

If you're feeling brave and looking to kick it up a notch not to worry! Your
couch can still be the only piece of equipment you use! This one has a little
more potential for injury, so only do it if you're really comfortable with
sliding in under your sofa, and confident you won't get crushed. There's
nobody watching when you work out in your living room so... don't be a hero.
