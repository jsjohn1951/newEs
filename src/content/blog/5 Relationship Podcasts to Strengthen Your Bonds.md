**Life has become considerably weird since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold of
the entire world (except allegedly North Korea, but our audience isn't coming
from there). As a result of the changes we've had to make to our lifestyles,
as we've already established inthis article, all of our romantic relationships
are being affected, some in more drastic ways than others. Whether forced
together or apart, there's no better time to work on your relationship with
your significant other than right now, and we've compiled a list of great
relationship podcasts that can provide you with some tips, ideas and
inspiration for how to go about doing that!**

### Where Should we Begin?

This beautifully produced series sees couples counsellor Esther Perel
recording unscripted counselling sessions with real life couples talking about
their real life stories. Each episode covers a different counselling session,
which is not only engaging, deeply personal and relatable, but which can also
teach us valuable lessons about sex, love, and romance as fundamental and
universal concepts. Perel is a wonderful and engaging host, with a fabulous
accent and loads of wisdom for every stage of a relationship. _Where Should We
Begin?_ truly is a celebration of humanity and the way we love, as well as all
the stubbornness and difficulties we have to over come when we do.

### Dear Sugars

The hosts of this podcast, Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond, know that when it
comes to love and relationships, it can be hard to know what the answers are,
and that's why they're here to help us find them. They take questions from,
and provide well-considered and empathetic advice to, listeners who like us,
are just trying to navigate the tricky terrain of love. They analyze
relationships in an unpretentious, eloquent and informative way, often
including guests who add valuable input to the discussion. One writer
described this podcast with the words "through generous and insistent
discourse, they’d expose someone’s singular struggle as being plainly,
universally, and stunningly human", and it's that relatable quality of this
series, it's ability to resound so clearly with so many, that makes this
podcast truly worth listening to.

  

### Just Break Up

"The podcast about love, heartbreak, and all the relationship advice you don't
want to hear."

This show's quirky hosts, Sierra DeMulder and Sam Blackwell, make talking
about the struggles of relationships feel okay. While going over listener
questions with a fine-tooth comb, they reveal deeply personal stories about
their own lives and relationships, make some dorky jokes, and bring a
lightness to the hard topics that can be very comforting and heartening. Like
_Dear Sugars_ , they provide insightful and well thought-out answers to
personal questions that somehow seem applicable to everyone, and will have you
feeling like you know them after just one episode. Despite being extremely
chatty and losing focus from time to time, as friends are wont to do, _Just
Break Up_ will have you tuning into the next episode immediately regardless of
your relationship status.

### Modern Love

Another great WBUR production, _Modern Love_ was built upon the popular New
York Times column of the same name. Host Meghan Chakrabarti invites notable
personalities, like Kate Winslet, Uma Thurman, Jake Gyllenhaal and tons more
to read deep and moving essays about love, written by column readers. The
essayists themselves then provide listeners with updates on how the situations
in their stories have resolved themselves. These stories of love, loss, and
redemption may not provide listeners with the practical advice that some of
the other podcasts we've mentioned do, but they certainly make for good
listening, and excellent reminders that love is never smooth sailing.

### Sex Nerd Sandra

Probably better for those couples who are confined together (but definitely
not for those with kids in the room), this risqué podcast with host and
sexuality professional Sandra Daugherty will have you giggling and cringing as
she discusses all aspect of sex in her candid and, often hilarious way. She
invites guests onto her show and they discuss techniques, problems, awkward
moments, and everything in between. It's engaging, humerous and practical, and
if you have an interest in the naughtier side of life, you won't want to turn
this podcast off. Listen with your partner, and you both might just learn a
thing or two. have fun!

Even if you're in a great place in your relationship, and we hope you are,
it's a wonderful idea to give some of these relationship podcasts a listen.
It's never a bad idea to equip your arsenal with some conflict resolution
skills, listening skills, and ideas about how to open up or communicate better
in a romantic relationship. Love is never simple and often it isn't a walk in
the park, but by learning from the relationships of others we can, hopefully,
improve the quality of ours without having to go through unnecessary struggles
and hurdles.

Go well, lovers.
