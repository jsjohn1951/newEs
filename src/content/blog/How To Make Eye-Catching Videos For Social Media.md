As a small business owner, you know that social media is a powerful tool to reach new customers and grow your brand. But what you may not realise is that video is one of the most effective types of content you can share on social media. In fact, 78% of people say they’ve watched an entire video on Facebook in the last week.

**To create eye-catching videos that keep your audiences engaged and generate more leads and conversions, make sure your videos start with a strong hook, use closed captions, thumbnails,  relevant tags and that they aren't too long.**

So, how can you create eye-catching videos that will capture attention and get results? Here are 7 tips:

## 1. Keep it short and sweet

The attention span of most viewers is very short, so it’s important to make your videos as concise as possible. Aim for videos that are 60 seconds or less.

## 2. Start with a strong hook

You only have a few seconds to capture someone’s attention, so make sure your video starts strong. Use an attention-grabbing image or video clip, and make sure your first few seconds are engaging and exciting.

## 3. Use descriptive captions

Captions are important for two reasons: They help viewers understand your video if they can’t hear the audio, and they help search engines index your video so people can find it. Use descriptive captions that accurately describe what’s happening in your video.

## 4. Use relevant tags

Tags are another way to help people find your video. When you upload your video to a social media platform like YouTube, be sure to include relevant tags so people can easily discover your content.

## 5. Optimise your title and thumbnail

Your title and thumbnail are the first things people will see when they come across your video, so make sure they’re catchy and inviting. Use attractive visuals and descriptive text to give viewers a taste of what your video is about.

## 6. Promote your video

Once you’ve created your video, it’s important to promote it to ensure as many people as possible see it. Share it on your social media channels, embed it on your website, and send it to your email list.

## 7. Analyse your results

After you’ve promoted your video, take some time to analyse the results. How many people watched it? How long did they watch it? Where did they come from? Which call to action led to the most conversions? Learning from your past videos will help you create even more successful ones in the future.

By following these tips, you can create eye-catching videos that people will want to watch and that will help you achieve your business goals.
